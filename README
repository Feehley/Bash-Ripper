There is no need to compile anything, the bash script takes care of it all.

"BashRipper"
The original program without a GUI.
Please add your own dictionary list into this directory and name it "passwords.txt".

"BashRipperGUI" 
Uses a whiptail GUI that can be used on most Unix distros.
The password file can be dynamically added by the user.  

Enjoy!
